# Data-Acquisition-and-Oscilloscope-System
This was my graduation project for my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering (2016-2017)

**The device gives users the ability to:**
- Accept both Analog and Digital signals via external sensors.
- Plot the data (Realtime or FFT).
- Process the data through flexible formulas and functions.
- Save data (in one file or in a number of files).

**Project Components and Features:**
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi (operating system: Debian GNU-Linux) with 8-channel / 10-bit MCP3008 Analog to Digital converter. Connected to a screen.
